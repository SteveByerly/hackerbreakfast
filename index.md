### Welcome

Hacker Breakfast is a weekly meeting of local people interested in all things technology. Bring a laptop and come work on your projects in the company of other fantastic hackers. Share ideas, get advice, eat baked goods, and drink coffee!

### Schedule

We meet **every Sunday at 10:00 a.m.**

There is no official agenda and people come and go as they please, but most of us stick around for a couple of hours. Swing by any time and say hello!

### Location

Hacker Breakfast takes place at [Revel 77 Coffee](http://www.revel77coffee.com/) on the South Hill.

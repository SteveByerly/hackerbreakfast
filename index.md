### Welcome

Hacker Breakfast is a weekly meeting of local people interested in all things
technology. No matter the flavor of your nerdery, we'd love to meet you and see
what you're in to. Bring a laptop and come work on your projects in the company
of other fantastic hackers. Share ideas, get advice, eat baked goods, and drink
coffee!

### Schedule

**We meet every Sunday at 10:00 a.m.**

There is no official agenda and people come and go as they please, but most of
us stick around for a couple of hours. Swing by any time and say hello!

### Location

UPDATE! We're trying a new location for Sunday Feb 16th,
[Coeur Coffeehouse](http://coeurcoffeehouse.com) just north of downtown. This
is a bit more centralized for people and we'll see if it's a good fit for the
group.

> 701 N Monroe St<br>
> Spokane, WA  99201-2107
